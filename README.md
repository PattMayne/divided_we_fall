# DIVIDED WE FALL

This is a command line tool to generate divider-style comments to paste labels in your code.
It won't make ASCII art. Just a simple label surrounded by a border of characters.

## TO BE ADDED
* options for style of comment (c style is default, but others should be available (use an enum possibly, and pattern matching))
