# DIVIDED WE FALL

This is a command line tool to generate divider-style comments to paste labels in your code.
It won't make ASCII art. Just a simple label surrounded by a border of characters.
Takes arguments to change border thickness, amount of whitespace, border character, and comments style (based on language)
